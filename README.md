## Rural E-mobility
**Overview**                                                         
Africa is facing the fastest growing rate in vehicle growth where most countries have annual vehicle sales rates of over10% compared to 4% in European countries. Additionally, most African countries are also facing mobility challenges in terms of congestion, inadequate infrastructure, air pollution, health issues, and fiscal burden high fuel prices and subsidies place on the economy. Electric vehicles may provide fantastic solutions to these problems. Since people in Africa travel an average distance of less than 80km with an average speed of 60km/h, Ev solutions are technically and economically perfect fit. Moreover, EVs have also gained attention as a strategy to decrease petroleum dependency and boost energy security in the context of increasing transport demand. Several Sub-Saharan African countries have already made significant steps in improving their overall vehicle fuel economy, enforcing vehicle standards and regulations such as the Climate Change Act in Kenya, or promoting non-motorized urban transport in Kigali, Rwanda.
